## Problem Title
*SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers*

---

## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals.  
Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

---

## Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved
Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory  
- Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance  
- Weather-based alerts and predictive insights  
- Pest/disease detection via image uploads  
- Market price tracking  
- Voice support for low-literate users  
- Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement

## Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries
- Small and marginal farmers  
- Agricultural extension officers  
- Government agriculture departments  
- NGOs and cooperatives  
- Agri-tech startups  

---

## Supporting Data
- *86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal* (NABARD Report, 2022)  
- Studies show *ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%*

## Proposed Solution
We propose a *multilingual, AI-powered crop advisory system* delivered through a mobile application and chatbot.  

*Key Features:*
- Farmers can upload crop images for pest/disease detection.  
- Real-time weather and soil-based recommendations.  
- Market price integration to guide selling decisions.  
- Voice-enabled support for farmers with low literacy.  
- Offline-first functionality for areas with poor connectivity.  

*Innovation and Uniqueness:*  
Unlike existing solutions, this system combines *AI-based image recognition, multilingual voice support, and localized advisory* in one platform, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for small and marginal farmers.

---

## Technical Approach
*Technologies to be used:*  
- Programming Languages: Python, Kotlin/Java (for Android)  
- AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch for pest detection and recommendation models  
- Backend: Firebase/AWS  
- APIs: Weather API, Market Price API  
- Database: Cloud Firestore or MySQL  

*Methodology:*  
1. Collect soil, weather, and crop input data.  
2. Process data with AI/ML models.  
3. Provide advisory through a mobile app with chatbot and voice support.  
4. Continuous feedback loop improves recommendations.

## Feasibility and Viability
*Challenges:*  
- Limited digital literacy among farmers  
- Poor network connectivity in rural areas  
- Need for localized datasets  

*Solutions:*  
- Voice-based support in multiple languages  
- Offline-first mobile app with sync capabilities  
- Partnerships with agricultural universities and state departments for dataset collection  

---

## Impact and Benefits
*Social:* Empowers farmers with knowledge in their own language  
*Economic:* Reduces input costs, increases crop yield, improves market access  
*Environmental:* Promotes sustainable farming, reduces overuse of fertilizers and pesticides
